# shootingGame
A shooting game between two teams takes place in a house with obstacles and hiding places. Each team consists of two fighters, with one of the fighters being the human player on one of the teams.

At the beginning of the game, the fighters have no weapons. The weapons must be found in the field, with guns and grenades hidden in random places. When players come across a weapon, they automatically pick it up. The human player needs to click on the weapon to acquire it. To shoot a gun, the SPACE key is pressed, and to throw a grenade, the Q key is pressed. The ammunition for bullets or grenades is unlimited.

One player, known as the commander, sets the movement goal, and the other player follows the commander's lead. In a group with a human player, the NPC (non-player character) follows the human player. Each NPC independently decides when to shoot or throw a grenade.
